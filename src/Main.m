% Description:   Runs a program that simulates the dynamics and control of
%                a 3DOF double pendulum-sliding cart system. The system is
%                under single-axis control (of the cart's horizontal
%                position) and uses the state space representation with
%                linearization about four fixed points near which the
%                system is controllable. Friction is neglected.
